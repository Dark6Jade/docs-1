# Types

<<<<<<< HEAD:docs/operations/polygon-zkevm/types.md
Chainstack supports deploying a Polygon zkEVM node of the following types:

* Elastic — a highly scalable public network node infrastructure accessed through your exclusive endpoint.
* Dedicated — a dedicated node that is exclusive to you.
=======
Chainstack currently supports deploying elastic Oasis Network nodes only.
>>>>>>> 3ed4085 (removed dedicated options from oasis operations):docs/operations/oasis/types.md

With an elastic node, you pay for JSON-RPC requests to the node and do not pay for the compute and storage resources used by the node.
